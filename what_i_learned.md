# What I Learned

- **Digit Manipulation Techniques**  
  Practiced extracting and rebuilding numbers with `%` and `/`, a fundamental numeric pattern.

- **Constraint-Driven Design**  
  Reinforced that string conversions, while convenient, can violate strict space requirements.

- **Overflow Awareness**  
  Learned to add defensive checks to keep intermediate results within safe integer bounds.

- **Simplicity & Efficiency**  
  Saw that a straightforward mathematical approach can be both simple and high-performance when carefully implemented.
