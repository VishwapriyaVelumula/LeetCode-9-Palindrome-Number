# Challenges Faced

- **Handling Negative Values**  
  Needed an early check for `x < 0` to avoid reversing and comparing negatives.

- **Avoiding String Conversion**  
  Reversing digits mathematically is more error-prone than simply converting to string, but it meets the space constraint.

- **Overflow Safety**  
  Ensuring intermediate reversed value stays within 32-bit limits required careful checks before each digit append.

- **Edge Cases**  
  Numbers ending in `0` (e.g., `10`) and single-digit inputs needed explicit handling to avoid incorrect results.
